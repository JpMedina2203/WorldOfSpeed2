                            The Kawasaki ZX-25R is the latest addition to the Ninja sportbike lineup following the same visual aesthetics of its bigger siblings with an aggressive riding position and Kawasaki racing livery designed to make a statement in the race track. This high-revving inline-4 sportbike was officially launched in the Philippines on July 31, 2020.
                            <br><br>
                            The ZX-25R harks back to the powerful inline-4 engines that powered legendary Kawasaki sportbikes in the past decades but in a more compact and updated package. It comes with 37 mm Showa SFF Big Piston adjustable inverted forks in the front and a horizontal preload-adjustable backlink mono-shock in the rear. Stopping duties are provided for by a 310 mm brake disk with a four-piston caliper for the front and a 220 mm disc with a single-piston caliper for the rear.
                            <br><br>
                            This Kawasaki screamer is powered by a liquid-cooled inline four-cylinder engine that’s capable of producing 50 hp (with ram air) at 15,500 RPM and 22.9 Nm of torque at 14,500 RPM. It is mated to a 6-speed transmission with an assist and slipper clutch for a lighter pull as well as a Kawasaki Quickshifter for even faster and smoother gear changes and even quicker lap times. It gives a much wider rev range of up to more than 15,000 RPM with most of its power delivery felt from its low to mid-range level.
                            <br><br>
                            It comes standard with dual-channel ABS, and Kawasaki Traction Control (KTRC). Its dash comes with a combination of an analog tachometer and digital LCD multi-info panel giving the rider all the standard gauges, readouts, gear indicators. Lastly, it has two selectable riding modes with Low, and Full.

                                Reintroduced in the Philippines earlier in 2019, the MV Agusta F3 675 is the baseline model of the F3 series from the Italian motorcycle manufacturer. It was first showcased at the EICMA motorcycle show in Milan and was introduced in 2012. It incorporates the dynamic lines of the F4 series, complemented by a diamond headlight, tapered seat shell, and single-sided swingarm. The F3 differs from the F4 with the side positioning of the tailpipe. It was in 2013 when MV Agusta split the F3 nameplate into two engine offerings: a 675 cc and 800cc. For the Philippine market, this bike is made available with only one ABS variant which retails at P1,100,000.
                                <br><br>
                                Locally, the F3 is offered with two variants: the base F3 675 ABS model and F3 675 RC. The RC was inspired by MV racers, which gave birth to an uprated 16.5-liter gasoline engine and modified chassis. Handling and stability are superb, thanks to MV Agusta’s signature short wheelbase, steep steering head angle, and short trail. This is accentuated by a short steel lattice frame with an aluminum swingarm, giving the bike the aggressive aerodynamic body.
                                <br><br>
                                At the heart of the F3 675 is a 16.5-liter liquid-cooled, four-stroke DOHC 675 cc engine. This mill comes with a 6-speed manual transmission. The MV Agusta F3 675 is capable of up to 110 hp and 71 Nm of torque.
                                <br><br>
                                Safety and convenience features include ABS and traction control system (both regular and cornering), slipper clutch, steering damper, engine immobilizer, a full set of LED lighting system, pass switch, quick shifter, and digital display screen. It also features MV Agusta’s four riding modes, namely Normal, Rain, Sport, and Custom.

                                Launched in October 2019, the Suzuki Katana 1000 is the Japanese brand's new contender in the super sport bike segment. This sharp-looking bike is a mix of a powerful engine and top-notch engineering. It is designed based on Suzuki GSX S1000 and was improved for a more aesthetically-pleasing appearance. This legend is priced at P817,000.

                                The Suzuki Katana embraces a boxy body, an LED headlamp, and has a swingarm-mounted satellite fender. Giving the rider's information is the LCD instrument. It also has modern features like easy start, Low RPM Assist, three-mode traction control, and Anti-lock Braking System (ABS).
                                <br><br>
                                For great rideability, it comes with inverted front forks, along with a monoshock with adjustable preload and damping. Safety features are taken care of by dual disc brakes with Brembo Monobloc as well as a single disc with Nissin caliper at the rear.
                                <br><br>
                                Powering this super sport bike is a 999cc four-cylinder engine that can deliver a maximum output of 150 hp and 108 Nm of torque. This power mill is then coupled to a 6-speed manual transmission.

                                Excellent handling, superb engineering, smart aerodynamics, and a 300km/h-plus top speed—it’s no wonder that the Suzuki Hayabusa GSX-R1300 has been regarded as one of the best performance bikes in the world since 1999. This fast machine comes with a sticker price of P1,199,000
                                <br><br>
                                For the price, you’d also get a load of features. The Suzuki Drive Mode Selector (S-DMS) lets the rider match the Hayabusa’s power delivery to the riding conditions. A steering damper feature is designed to ease unwanted vibration and steering forces. Behind the handlebars are four analog gauges including a tachometer and speedometer. There's also an LCD panel that includes a clock, gear position indicator, S-DMS indicator, odometer, and dual trip meters take center stage. An engine rpm light is also available to ensure accurate shifts from the rider. Lastly, a bright LED taillight with a clear inner lens and a red outer lens can be seen at the back.
                                <br><br>
                                What makes the ‘Busa’ charge all the way to that magical number is a two-valve, fuel-injected and liquid-cooled inline-four, 1,340cc engine. That mill produces a whopping 197 hp and 155 Nm of torque and contains some mechanical wizardry that includes Suzuki’s advanced fuel injection system called Suzuki Dual Throttle Valve (SDTV). It’s said to improve combustion efficiency and give smooth throttle response. The Hayabusa’s engine is coupled to a close-ratio, constant-mesh six-speed transmission.
                                <br><br>
                                To avoid the ultra-sport bike to get out of hand, there are dual 310mm floating-brake rotors that are connected to Brembo front brake calipers. The stoppers are lighter and more rigid than conventional calipers, delivering better feedback and better control. An Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is also included in the host of safety features.
